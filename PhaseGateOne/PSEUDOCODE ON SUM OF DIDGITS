PSEUDOCODE FOR SUM OF DIGITS

Prompt the user to enter an integer
 collect and store it as integer
 initialize a variable called remainder to zero
intialize a variable called total to zero

using a while  sentinel loop with sentinel value while integer > 0

use: integer % 10 to obtain the remainder

store the result and call it "remainder"

increment the total using: total + remainder

divide the integer by 10 using the floor division (integer//10) 
replace it with the value of the integer

the while loop will repeat this process until the sentinel Value stops the while loop

display the result using "The sum of the digits is: {total}"
