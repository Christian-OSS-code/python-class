PSEUDOCODE ON SUBTRCATION PROBLEM

set the math.randint method to generate two random integers
call the first "number1" and the second "number2"
intialize count = 0
intialize correct_answer_count = 0
initialize total_score = 0
initialize user_response = 0

use a while loop and set count from zero to count less than 10 as the loop continuation condition

use the if and else statement to prompt the user to enter their response and score each question as they respond

if number2 > number1:
create a variable called temporary variable

store number1 as the temporary number variable
swap number1 and number2 by storing number 1 and number2
then store the temporary number as number1
display the question:
 
temporary number - number2

Prompt the user to enter their response
 
if user_response == temporary_number - number2

increment correct_answer_count by one (correct_answer_count += 1)
increment count by one (count += 1)


else:
    display the question "what is number1 - number2
    prompt the user to enter their response
if user_response == number1- number2
increment correct_answer_count by one (correct_answer_count += 1)
increment count by one (count += 1)

display: You got "correct_answer_count" questions
display You scored "correct_answer_count/count"
